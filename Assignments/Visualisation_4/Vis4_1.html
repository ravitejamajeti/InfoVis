    <h2>1. Magnitude as position on a common scale</h2>
	<p>This demonstrates Magnitude as a position on common scale</p>
	<p>I used random data to generate this chart. We can assume X-axis as Student-ID and Y-axis as Marks secured by student. That shows magnitude as position on Y-axis and X-axis as common scale</p>
	<p>Marks - Lines, Channel - Vertical and Horizantal Spatial Position, Channel Types - Magnitude</p>
	<p>Discriminability can be observed by the length of bar</p>
